# Architecture
1. JVM architecture  
2. Where does local, class variables, methods, threads are initialized in memory
Q. Can I import the same package/class twice? Will the JVM load the package twice at runtime?
    Ans: One can import the same package or same class multiple times. Neither compiler nor JVM complains about it. 
	But the JVM will internally load the class only once no matter how many times you import the same class.  
3. Garbage collection and its changes in different versions of Java  
4. What if we instantiate the same Object in finalize() method?    
Q. what is Type- References in Java. How to distinguise between them?

Q) 	Use of '_' as an identifier might not be supported in releases after Java SE 8
	Ans:- '_'is not valid in Lambdas, From Java SE9, '_' should not be used as an identifier, since it is a reserved keyword from source level 1.8 on
	eg:
	String _ = "ABC"; //Java 8 valid
	String _ = "ABC"; //Java 9 onwards Invalid

# General Answers
**1. Principal concepts of OOPS?**  

   **A-PIE**  
   **A** - Abstraction (Hiding the implementation complexity)  eg:Abstract Classes.
   **P** - Polymorphism (1 Interface many implementations, achieved with help of Overloading and Overriding)  
   
        a. method Overloading(**Compile Time Polymorphism**)  
        b. method Overriding(**Run Time**) through inheritance (Child extends Parent and Overrides color() method)  
        c. method Overriding(**Run Time**) through Interface (Multiple implementations, Mostly used in service and Dao layer)  

   **I** - Inheritance ( promotes code reuse via polymorphism)  
   **E** - Encapsulation ( data hiding via `private setters` that can have validation and `public getters` )  

   **Note:** Grady Booch in Object Oriented Analysis and Design
   > Abstraction and encapsulation are complementary concepts: abstraction focuses on the observable behavior of an object.encapsulation focuses upon the implementation that gives rise to this behavior. encapsulation is most often achieved through information hiding, which is the process of hiding all of the secrets of object that do not contribute to its essential characteristics

**2. Different forms of Polymorphism?**    
     *Compile Time:* Overloading  
     *Run Time:* Overriding  

**3. Difference between Overloading and Overriding?**  

  |             | OverLoading Method   |       Overriding Method                   |
  | ----------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
  | Arguments   | **Must** Change      | **Must NOT** Change                       |
  | Return Type | **Can** Change       | **Can't** Change except for **Co-variants**|
  | Exceptions  | **Can** Change       | **Can reduce or Eliminate, Must not** throw newer or broader checked exceptions|
  | Access      |   **Can** Change     | **Can be less restrictive**               |
  | Invocation  | Reference type determines which overloaded version is selected. Happens at compile time|Object type determines which method is selected. Happens at runtime |

**4. Access Modifiers/Soecifiers in Java?**  
     Public  
     Protected (example `clone()` from `java.lang.Object`)  
     default (package private)  
     private  
     
**5. String vs StringBuffer vs StringBuilder?**  

  |  String                           |  StringBuffer                    |  StringBuilder                      |
  | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
  |  Immutable                        | Mutable                          | Mutable                             |
  |  Synchronized                     | Synchronized                     | Not Synchronized                    |
  |  use when text will not change    | use when in multi threaded env   | use when there is no multi-threading |

 **6. Is java pass by value or pass by reference? swap 2 numbers by passing them in method and changing references**
	Java is pass by value
	Example: https://github.com/girirajvyas/java-programmes/blob/master/java-programmes/src/io/girirajvyas/oops/TestPassByValue.java
	
**7. What are the packages that you used in java?**
    
  | Package name |      Use             |
  | ------------ | -------------------- |
  |  java.lang   | default package      | 
  |  java.util   |                      | 
  |  java.math   |                      |

**8. Methods in Object class?**
   There are total 9 methods in Object class and few of them can be clubbed together based on how they are used.  
     
   a. equals and hashcode (2)
     
```java
     public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        return (this == obj);
     }
    
     public native int hashCode();
```
   b. wait, notify and notifyAll (3)
   
```java
     public final void wait() throws InterruptedException {
        wait(0);
     }
     public final native void wait(long timeout) throws InterruptedException;
     public final void wait(long timeout, int nanos) throws InterruptedException {
        if (timeout < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("timeout value is negative");
        }
        if (nanos < 0 || nanos > 999999) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                                "nanosecond timeout value out of range");
        }
        if (nanos > 0) {
            timeout++;
        }
        wait(timeout);
     }
     
     public final native void notify();
     
     public final native void notifyAll();
```
   c. clone (1)

```java
      protected native Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException;
```
      
   d. toString (1)
     
```java
     public String toString() {
        return getClass().getName() + "@" + Integer.toHexString(hashCode());
     }
```
   e. finalize (1)
   
```java
     protected void finalize() throws Throwable { }
```
   f. getClass (1)
   
```java
   public final native Class<?> getClass();
```

**9. If Child extends Parent and as every class extends Object, How is it possible?**
**10. Object Lifecycle (from new to garbage collection)**  
**11. Can I instantiate Abstract class and Does it have constructor?**  
       No, You cannot instantiate an Abstract class. Although even if you try to do new, you have to create anonymous inner class to provide the implementation of the abstract methods from abstract class
