	Introduce yourself- name, work with belarus, responsible for 
	Recording permission from candidate. why - 1)Speed up the process, 2) Quality check
	Interview structure:- 
	Several part:- previous exp, role set , past porj, technical/general acheivements, we will write some code and discuss it, technical topics, communication with customer not technical, in the end if you have questions about epam. i'll try to answer, if not I'll ask TA teamto get back to you with ans
	
# How to Check Soft skills:
	STAR Technique: 
	Situation, Task, Action, Result.
	An interviewer suggests an imagined situation a candidate might face and gives a task.  A candidate should explain an action in a particular case, highlight the result, and explain what behavior led to it. 
	For instance, you can use it to describe some real-life situations from the past.
	
	Example:
	1) Explain your largest failure at work. What did you learn from this experience? And how did you cope with it?
	Ans: Well, to begin with, let's outline the situation: Several years ago, on one of my previous projects I committed the change that introduced the critical error on the production service.
	**Task**: My project manager informed me that I need to fix it as soon as possible.
	**Action**: That’s why I decided to stay late and find the way to get the service up and running again. I applied the hotfix and released it shortly after.
	**Result**: Since then, I verify the changes several times on a local machine and ask other engineers to verify them too.
	
	Some Interestig Questions:
	
	**1.** Tell me about your professional accomplishments (some specific tasks or features) you are proud of?
	**2.** Tell me about the task/ situation that was a real challenge/ tough stuff for you/ serious professional mistake over the past 6 months?
	**3.** (for seniors and leads) Imagine you have a task from the customer and several approaches/ tools/ ways to complete it (be more specific here, in accordance with the profession of the candidate). Which tool would you choose and why? Please guide me through your reasoning.
	**4.** Tell me about a situation when you had to skip/ neglect minor rules while aiming to achieve your goal (faster).
	**5.** Tell me about a task you had to complete very quickly, yet you did not have all the information you needed.
	**6.** (for senior and leads) Please describe a situation where you demonstrated your leadership.
	**7.** Please describe a situation where you had to challenge decision of your colleague, manager or more experienced member of a team.
	**8** Tell me about a project with an aggressive timeline.
	**9.**Tell me about the most unusual or creative idea that you’ve ever come up with.
	**10.**(for mature A2 and A3-4) Suppose you were asked to lead a team…
	**11.**What would you start with? How do you think you would handle a situation, if…
		- Someone disagreed with your recommendations.
		- You were asked to do something for which you didn’t have proper technical skills?
		- You were trying to confirm a decision and your manager wasn’t getting back to you?
	**12.** As a Lead SE you are on a project working with five other engineers. The group opinion on the proper design to proceed with divided: half the group wants to proceed one way and the other half wants to take another way. How would you handle this situation?
	**13.** If you were given complete freedom of choice how would your ideal project/team look like?
	
## Tips for checking Soft Skills:
	
### Ability to learn:
	
	- If a candidate has been using the same technology stack or performing the same duties for more than 4-5 years, ask about the reason for that.
	- Ask if the candidate started to learn anything new, who initiated that, and what was the reason for that.
	
### Communication: 
	Pay attention to presentation, behaviour, clarification questions that a candidate asks.

### Critical thinking:
	- When Candidate describe a project: ask suggestion for there is any process that can be improved.
	- Ask if he has ever suggested any improvement.

### LeaderShip:
	Ask if he has ever managed a team/ people in any activity.
	
### Problem Solving:
	Ask candidate's exp in sovling conflicts or any problemetic situations.
	Like: Imagine You have an Ecommrece web applicaiton hosted in cluster and DB on Seperate server. User reports slowdown of single page.
	Slowdown is sporadic(sometime slow, sometime fast) other pages are fine.
	
	ans: Check Systematic approach
	

### Reliability and teamwork:
	-Pay attention wheather candidate blames them without ang good reason.

### Stress resistance:
	Check behaviour in high responsibility, 
	
#Q) Suppose You need to hire a candidate, what is your step towards it?
	
	1) Understand Requirement- Do we need to take into account only tech skills or Soft skills?
	2) Depends on budget- Do we require a experience candidate or we can leavrage some resource to tech them those skills.
	3) If anhy specific requirement for a project- we should concentrate on those skills primarly and ask him questions related to that technical assements.
	4) If there is requirement of writting code, there should be more coding tasks.
	
#Q) Suppose a candidate passes the technical interview, now its time to onboarding. How will you set-up onboarding on your project?
	
	 We have like document, which describe all the onboarding steps, just to not forget.When a candidate join in our team, we create a new version of this doc and fill all the checkboxes as he progress with the steps.
	 This doc also have all the links and supported docs for all the necessary request for accounts and to downloads necessary tools.
	 also we Assign one buddy(a team member) who can help him in case he has any query.
	 
##Q) What steps can a buddy should do in order to successfuly onboard a new comer?
	He should help him in case of any query be it related to raising requests etc.
	Usually in starting days newcomers should not assign tough job at the start. We start with comparatably easy job and also with pair programming
	We gradually increasing the toughness of problem so as to make him feel comfortable. Ifhe able to grasp these changes, we can say, candidate has successfully onboarded.

#Q) What are the responsibilty of team lead?
	
	Depends on the team. If the team is more mature and skilled, team lead should help when there is issue which is not resoving bu them.
	If the team is not that skills, team lead should share his experience. 
	Team lead should responsible for the growth of the team.
	Team should perform well, so TL should distribute tasks to right guys who can do things in more performant way. If time allows, he can also give tasks to guy who can grow, TL should think about it. 

#Q) Recall some conflict in your team.

#Q) Recall some resolution you make about Customer Conflict, like customer suggested some change and wasnot happy with the result.
	Expain less documentation from customer side and few requirements are coming on teams channel. After that we started attaching snapshot in jira/rally.
	After that Customer was satisfied.
	
#Q) How will you discuss/convince tech stack with the customer?
	Depends on several factors: 
	1) What is overall expectation in terms of costs. Like serverless is a best option but lambda would cost you more. So can we use free softwares instead.
	2) How skilled people in my team. DO we require skill set enhancement or can work with existing team.
	
#@) One day you found out that one of the team members has deleted data from the production? What action would you perform as a TL?
	1) First of all we should inform the stakeholders with a plan to resolve the issue, estimated time for.
	**To Prevent such thing:**
	We should focus on automatized pipelines. Focus on quality gates, deployment strategies, security policies(like the developers should not have access to prod data).
